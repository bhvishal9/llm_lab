# Kubernetes Introduction

Kubernetes is a container orchestration system used to manage containerized applications at scale.

Core concepts:
- Pod: the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, usually wrapping one or more containers.
- Deployment: manages a set of identical Pods and ensures the desired number of replicas.
- Service: provides a stable network endpoint to access Pods.

Kubernetes is often abbreviated as K8s. It supports rolling updates, self-healing, and scaling.
