# Terraform Basics

Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool used to provision and manage cloud resources.

Key ideas:
- Configuration files are written in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).
- `terraform init` initializes the working directory.
- `terraform plan` shows the proposed changes.
- `terraform apply` executes the changes.

Terraform keeps state about the resources it manages, usually stored in a state file.
