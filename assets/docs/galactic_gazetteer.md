# A Gazetteer of the Celestial Bathtub and Beyond

This document contains a partial list of systems and planets cataloged by the Quack-Federa-tion exploration vessel *The Indefatigable Bubble*.

## Sector 1: The Drain Anomaly

### System: Suds-Alpha
- **Planet 1: Soapstone**
  - **Description:** A rocky planet with vast, smooth plains of a silicate material resembling soap. The atmosphere is thick with a fragrant, bubbly vapor. Not habitable for most carbon-based life.
  - **Resources:** Silicate compounds, volatile gases.
- **Planet 2: Suds-Alpha-2 (The Foam Giant)**
  - **Description:** A gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, and a mysterious compound that gives it a foamy, iridescent appearance. Its high gravity and turbulent atmosphere make exploration difficult.
  - **Resources:** Helium-3, exotic gases.

### System: Vortex-Prime
- **Planet 1: Whirlpoolia**
  - **Description:** A tidally locked water world, with one side perpetually facing its star. This creates a massive, permanent hurricane at the terminator line. The Quack-Federa-tion has an outpost on the calmer, dark side of the planet.
  - **Resources:** Heavy water, aquatic lifeforms, tidal energy.
- **Planet 2: The Drain Stopper**
  - **Description:** A rogue planetoid captured by the Vortex-Prime system. It has an unusually high density and a powerful magnetic field, which is believed to cause the Drain Anomaly. All expeditions to the surface have failed.
  - **Resources:** Unknown, presumed to be ultra-dense metals.

## Sector 2: The Loofah Line

### System: Scrubber-7
- **Planet 1: Exfolia**
  - **Description:** A desert world covered in abrasive, crystalline sands. The planet is in a slow process of disintegration due to the gravitational pull of its neighbors and the harsh stellar winds. The sand is composed of a material perfect for polishing starship hulls.
  - **Resources:** Abrasive crystals, silicon.
- **Planet 2: Bristle**
  - **Description:** A dense jungle world where the flora is made of a tough, fibrous material similar to the cosmic Loofah Line. The plants are highly aggressive and will attempt to scrub anything that comes near them.
  - **Resources:** High-tensile fibers, volatile organic compounds.

### System: Lather-Beta
- **Planet 1: Latheria**
  - **Description:** A temperate world with continents of soft, porous rock formations. The oceans are slightly viscous and have a tendency to foam when agitated. This is a primary colony world for the Quack-Federa-tion.
  - **Resources:** Arable land, fresh water, diverse biosphere.
- **Planet 2: The Bar**
  - **Description:** A rectangular, oddly shaped asteroid that orbits Latheria. It is believed to be an ancient artifact of a precursor race. It slowly dissolves into Latheria's oceans, giving them their unique properties.
  - **Resources:** Precursor artifacts, unique minerals.

## Sector 3: The Rubber Rim

### System: Vulcan-Alpha
- **Planet 1: Elastos**
  - **Description:** A highly volcanic world where the crust is primarily composed of a flexible, rubber-like polymer. Lava flows are slow and bouncy. The Quack-Federa-tion harvests this material for starship construction.
  - **Resources:** Vulcanized polymers, geothermal energy.
- **Planet 2: Squeak Minor**
  - **Description:** A small, rocky moon orbiting Elastos. Its thin atmosphere causes any movement on the surface to generate high-pitched squeaking sounds, a phenomenon that led to the discovery of the Squeak Drive.
  - **Resources:** Rare resonant crystals.

### System: Poly-Prime
- **Planet 1: Isoprene**
  - **Description:** A terrestrial planet with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The surface is covered in massive, rubbery forests. This was the ancestral homeworld of the Duck civilization.
  - **Resources:** Rich biodiversity, polyisoprene sap.
- **Planet 2: The Mold**
  - **Description:** A tidally locked planet with one side a scorched desert and the other an ice cap. At the terminator is a thin band of territory where the ice melts, creating massive rivers. It is believed the first Ducks were "molded" in these regions from the planet's unique clay.
  - **Resources:** Unique clays, water ice.

## Sector 4: The Faucet Flow

### System: Aqua-Spout
- **Planet 1: Deluge**
  - **Description:** A massive water world with no discernible land masses. The entire planet is a single, globe-spanning ocean thousands of kilometers deep. Home to colossal aquatic megafauna.
  - **Resources:** Water, biomass.
- **Planet 2: Droplet**
  - **Description:** A tiny, tear-drop shaped planetoid in a highly eccentric orbit around Deluge. It is composed almost entirely of a single, perfect water crystal.
  - **Resources:** Crystalline water (theoretical applications in bubble-fusion).

### System: Gurgle-Gamma
- **Planet 1: Echo-Rock**
  - **Description:** A mountainous planet with vast cave systems. The composition of the rock and the shape of the caves cause any sound to echo for hours, creating a constant, low-frequency hum across the planet.
  - **Resources:** Mineral ores, unique acoustic data.
- **Planet 2: Backwash**
  - **Description:** A retrograde gas giant with rings of ice and debris that orbit opposite to the planet's spin. This creates a chaotic and dangerous environment for navigation.
  - **Resources:** Water ice, ammonia.

## Sector 5: The Deep End

### System: Abyss-9
- **Planet 1: Nopul-Prime**
  - **Description:** A dark, cold world far from its star. The surface is covered in a thick layer of frozen nitrogen. It is notable for its complete lack of any interesting features, a true void in the cosmos.
  - **Resources:** Nitrogen ice.
- **Planet 2: The Voidfish's Maw**
  - **Description:** A super-massive black hole at the center of the Abyss-9 system. It is theorized to be the "drain" of the Celestial Bathtub itself. Quack-Federa-tion science vessels maintain a safe distance, studying its gravitational effects.
  - **Resources:** None. (Hazard)

### System: Submerge-Ternary
- **Star 1, 2, 3: The Triple Taps**
  - **Description:** A rare trinary star system. The complex gravitational interactions create "rogue waves" of stellar plasma that are a major navigational hazard.
- **Planet 1: Pressure-Point**
  - **Description:** A super-Earth with gravity 3x that of Isoprene. The atmosphere is incredibly dense, and the surface is crushed under immense pressure. Life, if it exists, would have to be extraordinarily resilient.
  - **Resources:** Heavy elements, high-pressure industrial diamonds.

## Sector 6: The Splash Zone

### System: Droplet-Delta
- **Planet 1: Mistral**
  - **Description:** A planet with a perpetual fine mist in its atmosphere, refracting the light of its star into constant rainbows. The surface is marshy and dotted with geysers.
  - **Resources:** Water vapor, rare atmospheric gases.
- **Planet 2: Puddle**
  - **Description:** A small, lumpy planetoid with shallow craters that collect water, forming a network of interconnected puddles. It is a popular recreational spot for the Quack-Federa-tion.
  - **Resources:** Recreational value, simple aquatic life.

### System: Ripple-Rho
- **Planet 1: Wave-Rider**
  - **Description:** An ocean planet with extremely predictable and stable wave patterns, caused by its three small moons. The inhabitants have built cities on floating platforms that ride these perpetual waves.
  - **Resources:** Aquaculture, tidal power.
- **Planet 2: The Calm Sea**
  - **Description:** A moon of Wave-Rider that is tidally locked. The side facing the planet has a perfectly calm, glassy ocean, shielded from all tidal forces.
  - **Resources:** Scientific observation posts, meditation retreats.

## Sector 7: The Porcelain Rim

### System: Glaze-Gamma
- **Planet 1: Kaolin**
  - **Description:** A world with vast deposits of white, smooth clay-like minerals. The surface has been vitrified in many places by ancient meteor impacts, creating plains of natural ceramic.
  - **Resources:** Kaolinite, industrial ceramics.
- **Planet 2: Fired-Earth**
  - **Description:** A planet that was once temperate but was sterilized by a nova from a neighboring star. Its surface is a cracked, baked landscape of reddish rock.
  - **Resources:** Iron oxides, irradiated minerals.

## Sector 8: The Bubble Bath Cluster

### System: Suds-Sigma
- **Planet 1: Perfuma**
  - **Description:** A world where the flora releases complex aromatic compounds into the atmosphere, creating a pleasant, ever-changing scent-scape. The Quack-Federa-tion has established perfume distilleries here.
  - **Resources:** Aromatic oils, botanical research.
- **Planet 2: The Bubble Nebula's Core**
  - **Description:** Not a planet, but a protostar forming within a dense nebula of gas and dust that is unusually rich in the elements that form soap bubbles.
  - **Resources:** Protostellar matter, complex hydrocarbons.
