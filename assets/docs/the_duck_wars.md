# The Great Duck Wars

The history of the Quack-Federa-tion is a long and storied one, but it is defined by one major conflict: The Great Duck Wars against the Absorbant Empire of Spong.

## The First Splish-Splash

The war began in the Celestial Bathtub nebula. The Quack-Federa-tion, a peaceful convoy of explorers, was charting the soapy currents when they encountered the Spong. The Spong, a porous and aggressive species, saw the Ducks' impermeable hulls as an affront to their very nature.

The Spong fleet, led by the notorious Admiral Suds, launched a surprise attack. Their primary weapon was the "Drainer," a device that could create micro-vortexes, threatening to pull the Duck ships into the sudsy depths of the nebula, where their hulls would be compromised by the extreme pressure.

## The Battle of the Loofah Line

The turning point of the war was the Battle of the Loofah Line. The Quack-Federa-tion, under the command of the brilliant Commodore Waddles, used their advanced hydro-thrusters to create a massive wave. This wave, known as the "Waddles Wave," pushed the Spong fleet into the abrasive Loofah Line, a dense field of cosmic scrub-material. The Spong ships, with their soft, absorbent exteriors, were torn to shreds.

Admiral Suds was captured, and the Absorbant Empire was forced to retreat. A tense peace was established, but the Quack-Federa-tion remains ever-vigilant, their squeaky sentinels patrolling the soapy frontiers.
