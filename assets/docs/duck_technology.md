# Technology of the Quack-Federa-tion

The technological prowess of the Duck civilization is based entirely on their mastery of hydro-dynamics and bubble-fusion.

## Propulsion Systems

Duck starships are not propelled by fire or plasma, but by highly advanced **Hydro-thrusters**. These engines take in cosmic water vapor and expel it at near-light speeds, creating a powerful, yet surprisingly gentle, thrust. The signature of a Duck ship is a faint trail of bubbles in its wake.

A key component of this system is the **Squeak Drive**. This device generates a high-frequency squeak that alters the surface tension of the water being expelled, allowing for instantaneous changes in velocity and direction. This makes Duck ships incredibly maneuverable, a key advantage they used in the Great Duck Wars.

## Weaponry and Defense

The primary defensive system of the Quack-Federa-tion is the **Bubble Shield**. This is not a solid barrier, but a complex, multi-layered field of reinforced bubbles. Each bubble is a miniature singularity, capable of absorbing and dissipating vast amounts of energy. When an enemy projectile hits the shield, it creates a satisfying 'pop' as the energy is harmlessly released.

Offensive technology is more limited, as the Ducks are a peaceful civilization. Their main "weapon" is the **Wave Generator**, a device that can manipulate gravitational tides to create massive waves, as demonstrated by Commodore Waddles. They also employ smaller, targeted water jets capable of slicing through softer materials.
